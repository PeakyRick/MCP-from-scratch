basically following the below example. Managed to give access to Claude Desktop of the tools I made, one of them is essentially the RSWall Wiki tool I am using on the side. 

Some Thoughts on MCP tools so far:
I haven't made it into exactly how the RSInsight RAG works. Currently, Claude Desktop itself can access tools, which essentially make it behave like an agent. The tool calling is still less reliable than the direct RAG that we've implemented.
Need to learn if it can call the tool better.
Also need to learn how to deploy in cloud. Trying it out with Render. Following this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOYkbXP-GGo

Some other way of using MCP with docker: https://www.docker.com/products/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/#get_updates

This is a simple example and a good explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDjjaTALI68
